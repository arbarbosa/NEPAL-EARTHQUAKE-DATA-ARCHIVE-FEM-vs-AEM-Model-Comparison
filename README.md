# NEPAL-EARTHQUAKE-DATA-ARCHIVE-FEM-vs-AEM-Model-Comparison
This repository contains a PDF report (https://github.com/arbarbosa/NEPAL-EARTHQUAKE-DATA-ARCHIVE-FEM-vs-AEM-Model-Comparison/blob/master/Soti_et_al_2019_ValidationReport.pdf), which provides two basic examples comparing Applied Element Method model results with Finite Element Method model results, for models dominated by flexural deformations, with the intent of modeling pagoda temples. 

This repository is part of the following publication https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.109950.
